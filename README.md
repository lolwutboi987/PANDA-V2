# PANDA-V2 #
Its here. Its back. Faster and better than ever. Redesigned with a focus on reliability and repeatability. 
Panda v2 is the second evolution of Panda, Designed specifically to increase the performacne window and to completely eliminate previous issues encountered and recorded in my testing of panda v1. Equipped with features that make it suitable for nearly any enviroment, like optical probing and increased rigidity, Panda v2 continues to explore and push the development of performance in cantilever-style bedslingers.
