## PRUSA 3D ##

My heart goes out to Prusa 3d for being a huge proponent of the reprap game and supporting me with a CORE ONE to make projects like these possible for young creators me! It's always fun to build your own printers, but it's important to have a reliable, well-crafted machine designed by people who've been printing longer than i've walked this earth. 

## LDO MOTORS ##

Shoutout to LDO motors for supporting me with high-performance motors to make this machine move!

## Polymaker ##

Big thanks to Polymaker for supporting me with a vast selection of materials and drying equipment to make anything printable. Polymaker has always had my back and I truly appreciate the support they have for young makers around the world, whether it be robotics or a humble kid in his bedroom, tinkering with things he shouldnt.

## Burgo's Machinations ##

Huge thanks to Sylvia (Burgo) for providing me with her WS7040 to keep the plastic cool, and teaching me the ways of mechanical engineering, especially when it comes to many important aspects of 3d printing. She taught me nearly everything I know, from sourcing parts to proper design when it comes to cadding 3d printers and building them. I would not be here, making the second revision of the already beloved panda if it werent for her generosity and kindness.

## Sirayatech ##

Thanks sirayatech for shipping out a spool of some of their highest quality material for making mission-critical parts, where purity upmost quality is important.
